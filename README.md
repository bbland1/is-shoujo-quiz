At its core, this project is a quiz page, but I wanted to add more to it by incorporating links and a first page to give it a unique twist. Being a fan of anime and manga, I was inspired by video essays I watched and decided to create a web page with a quiz based on one of the joke games mentioned in the videos.

I believe that Shoujo anime and manga often get overlooked or discussed more negatively compared to Shounen, so I wanted to create a fun web page to shed light on this genre. This project also served as an opportunity for me to challenge myself and develop a React project from scratch with my own idea.

I strongly believe that everyone should read and watch the anime/manga they enjoy, and it's important not to limit a demographic to a narrow stereotype. Through this project, I aimed to highlight the diversity and potential of Shoujo anime and manga beyond traditional perceptions.

So maybe give Shoujo or just anime and manga a try.
